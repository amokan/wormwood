An effort to experiment with some custom DSP matrix stuff for the [Shbobo Shnth](http://shbobo.net)

The `wanilla` files are from the Shnth483 release found at [http://shbobo.net/shnth483.zip](http://shbobo.net/shnth483.zip)

## Building

I'm building on OSX Yosemite with the `arm-none-eabi` toolchain setup. You will likely be able to build with other ARM tooling so please adjust the makefile as needed for your system.
